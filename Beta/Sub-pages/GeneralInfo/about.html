      <h1>A Brief History of the DTUTC</h1>

      <br />
      Since the conception of Atomism in Ancient Greece, the theory of multiple
      universes co-existing together has generated fascinating discussion and
      imagination. Fast forwarding to the 20th century, that idea has been
      proven correct by our nation's brightest minds.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the summer of 1953, Doctor Frederick Thompson from the Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology proposed the Thompson's Equation, an equation
      that, if applied correctly, can be used to rip open the space-time fabric
      that separates our universe from other universes. Dr. Thompson graciously
      submitted his works to the Department of Defense, and finally to President
      Eisenhower. President Eisenhower then promptly created the Office of
      Transuniversal Communication on July 5, 1953 with Dr. Thompson as its
      first and only Director. The Office then became an Executive Department
      through Congress five months later.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Department was small, but efficient. In just two years, we managed to
      establish a direct sub-atomic connection to another world. New projects
      and experiments continued to be created, and through time, better and
      stronger connection were established. From just observing a small amount
      of quarks moving around, we now have the ability to send and recieve large
      amounts of information from Planet Earth in so many universes that are so
      different from us.
      <br />
      <br />
      A new breakthrough happened in February of 1962 when Professor Dimitri
      Bonnet from the University of California, who was also a long-time
      employee at the Department, discovered the Bonnet Tunnel. A modification
      to the original Thompson's Equation that can be used to connect to
      different temporal periods within a five-thousand-year range. This
      discovery opened up infinite possibilities for the Department. Not only
      can we get information from another Earth, we can now get information from
      that Earth's future, something that those Earthlings might not even have
      the ability to do. It was also in 1962 that our Department was given the
      now-current name of the Department of Trans-Universal and Temporal
      Communication.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Department has, is and will contribute priceless knowledge in the
      fields of science, technology, and history for the security of our nation.
