      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p style="width: 50%">
        The project imagines an alternate universe where the events of "Five
        Nights at Freddy's" actually happened and the video games are based on
        real events. The project aims to recreate videos, photos, documents,
        Internet and other media in that alternate universe.

The games also generate an active fan community for the video game series and the company itself. Fazbear Entertainment chose to not do anything about the games. The video games's lore were based on speculations by Scott himself so while they are similar to our universe's lore, not every detail is correct. This universe's Scott Cawthon also released book series about the games.
