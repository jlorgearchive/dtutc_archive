                incredibly difficult time for you and Katherine, but I want you to know that I'm here for 
                you and I'm doing everything I can to find Charlie. 
                I've been working non-stop with the police, even gave them the security camera footage 
                from the night she went missing. We're going to find her, Henry. I have faith. 
                In the meantime, I know you need time to focus on your family, but I want to remind you 
                that we still have a business to run. If there's anything you need, anything at all, please 
                let me know. I'll take care of it. You just focus on bringing Charlie home. Take care, my 
                friend.

                <b>WILLIAM AFTON:</b> Henry, what the hell is going on? I've been getting calls left and right about how our 
                restaurants have been going to absolute shit! This E. coli thing is a PR nightmare and I 
                can smell a lawsuit coming up! I know Charlie's disappearance has been tough on you 
                but you can't let it affect the business like this! If it makes you feel better, I admit it's my 
                fault for not being there that night. Is that enough for you? Now, please snap out of it 
                and get your shit together. Call me back as soon as you can.
