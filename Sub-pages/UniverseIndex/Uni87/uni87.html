    <h2 >Universal Difference</h2>
    <p>Events from the 2014 video game called <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> by Scott B. Cawthon happened in the United States.</p>
    <h2 id="summary">Universe Summary (1954-2040)</h2>
    <h3>Timeline Divergence</h2>
      <p><B>Universe 087</B> is a universe that is largely similar to our Universe for most of its history. The first major divergent of the historical timeline occurs when <B>Henry Johnson Emily</B> (04/04/1954) and <b>William Edwards Afton</b> (09/13/1957) were born in the Utahn city of Hurricane. History remains mostly the same for two decades until Emily and Afton  started their own chain of animatronic pizza restaurants called: <i>Fredbear's Family Diner</i> together in their birthplace in 1978. In 1983, an incident occured where the 3-year-old daughter of Emily went missing and was persumed dead. Emily also went missing that year, leaving Afton solely in charge of the company. Afton promptly sold the company to state entrepreneurs, who renamed the company to <i>Fazbear Entertainment Inc.</i>. The restaurant was also renamed to <i>Freddy Fazbear's Pizza</i>. The chain achieved national success with more than 104 locations opened in 42 U.S. states in 1985. However, a series of incidents with loss of life occured throughout the late 1980s led to numerous boycotts. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1992, with its final location closing in December of the same year. Information about William Afton could not be found after 1992.</p>
    <h3>Resurgence of Interests</h2>
      <p>In 2014, Texas resident <b>Scott Brandon Cawthon</b> released a video game about the company's past incidents. The video game titled <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i>, in the genre of "horror point-and-click", became popular after various "Let's Player" recorded video tapes of themselves reacting to the game and posting it to a video hosting web-site called <i>YouTube</i>. Cawthon continued developing more titles for the series throughout the 2010s. As part of <i>The Fazbear Restoration Project</i>, a horror attraction using the company's old assets called <i>Fazbear's Fright</i> was opened in March 2023. However, after just a week, it was the subject of a large building fire that destroyed most of its content. Official report blamed "faulty wiring".</p>
    <h3>A New Success</h2>
      <p>The unexpected increase of interests in the chain led to an official restart of <i>Fazbear Entertainment Inc.</i>, starting with the release of a virtual reality video game called <i>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted</i> in July 2024. In December 2026, the company announced reopening plans of the closed restaurants. The restaurants achieved international success with locations opening in more than 50 countries, surpassing <i>McDonald's Corporation</i>. In 2029, Fazbear Entertainment Inc. opened its first Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex, a 1980s-themed entertainment complex. The company continued to experience huge growth in profit, with its 2040 earning report reporting more than $130 billion in revenue.</p>
